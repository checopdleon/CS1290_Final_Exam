# CS1290_Final_Exam
The problems in this repo are the final exam for UTEP's CS1290 Course, Fall 2018. 

Each Problem will be answered in separate README's.  These README's will contain:
1. Recursive solution
2. A brief plan to memo-ize, ie, store, solutions to sub-problems in order to solve the overall problem

Solution source code for individual problems will be saved in separate files within the repo.
