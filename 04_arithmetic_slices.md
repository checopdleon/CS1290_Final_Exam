# Defining Problem/Solution recursively

### Repeating Sub-problem
Checking difference between three adjacent numbers is the s

### Properties of the Larger Problem
* Creating sets of integers
* Any set being considered should be at least three elemetns long

# Plan for Memo-ization
*Memos are used to help number of times the sub-problem is repeated*, so my plan is:

At the end of building the sets we just count the number of valid sets created
